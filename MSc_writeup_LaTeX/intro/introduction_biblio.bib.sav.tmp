  abstract  = {| Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a disorder characterized by a clonal proliferation derived
from primitive haematopoietic stem cells or progenitor cells. Abnormal differentiation of myeloid cells 
results in a high level of immature malignant cells and fewer differentiated red blood cells, platelets 
and white blood cells. The disease occurs at all ages, but predominantly occurs in older people 
(>60 years of age). AML typically presents with a rapid onset of symptoms that are attributable to bone 
marrow failure and may be fatal within weeks or months when left untreated. The genomic landscape 
of AML has been determined and genetic instability is infrequent with a relatively small number of 
driver mutations. Mutations in genes involved in epigenetic regulation are common and are early 
events in leukaemogenesis. The subclassification of AML has been dependent on the morphology and 
cytogenetics of blood and bone marrow cells, but specific mutational analysis is now being 
incorporated. Improvements in treatment in younger patients over the past 35 years has largely been 
due to dose escalation and better supportive care. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation may be used to consolidate remission in those patients who are deemed to be at high 
risk of relapse. A plethora of new agents — including those targeted at specific biochemical pathways 
and immunotherapeutic approaches — are now in trial based on improved understanding of disease 
pathophysiology. These advances provide good grounds for optimism, although mortality remains 
high especially in older patients.},

  abstract  = {Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults, with an incidence of over 20 000 cases per year in the United States alone. Large chromosomal translocations as well as mutations in the genes involved in hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation result in the accumulation of poorly differentiated myeloid cells. AML is a highly heterogeneous disease; although cases can be stratified into favorable, intermediate and adverse-risk groups based on their cytogenetic profile, prognosis within these categories varies widely. The identification of recurrent genetic mutations, such as FLT3-ITD, NMP1 and CEBPA, has helped refine individual prognosis and guide management. Despite advances in supportive care, the backbone of therapy remains a combination of cytarabine-and anthracycline-based regimens with allogeneic stem cell transplantation for eligible candidates. Elderly patients are often unable to tolerate such regimens, and carry a particularly poor prognosis. Here, we review the major recent advances in the treatment of AML.},

  abstract  = {Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal disease characterized by the proliferation and accumulation of myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow, which ultimately leads to hematopoietic failure. The incidence of AML increases with age, and older patients typically have worse treatment outcomes than do younger patients. Objective: This review is focused on current and emerging treatment strategies for nonpromyelocytic AML in patients aged <60 years. Methods: A literature review was conducted of the PubMed database for articles published in English. Publications from 1990 through March 2009 were scrutinized, and the search was updated on August 26, 2009. The search terms used were: acute myeloid leukemia in conjunction with treatment, chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation, and immunotherapy. Clinical trials including adults with AML aged ≥19 years were selected for analysis. Conference proceedings from the previous 5 years of The American Society of Hematology, The European Hematology Association, and The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation were searched manually. Additional relevant publications were obtained by reviewing the references from the chosen articles. Results: Cytarabine (AraC) is the cornerstone of induction therapy and consolidation therapy for AML. A standard form of induction therapy consists of AraC (100-200 mg/m 2), administered by a continuous infusion for 7 days, combined with an anthracycline, administered intravenously for 3 days. Consolidation therapy comprises treatment with additional courses of intensive chemotherapy after the patient has achieved a complete remission (CR), usually with higher doses of the same drugs as were used during the induction period. High-dose AraC (2-3 g/m 2) is now a standard consolidation therapy for patients aged <60 years. Despite substantial progress in the treatment of newly diagnosed AML, 20% to 40% of patients do not achieve remission with the standard induction chemotherapy, and 50% to 70% of first CR patients are 31[Theme Issue]:2349-2370)},
