\chapter{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Leukaemia is a cancer of the hematopoietic system, and is classified according to the affected cell lineage and according to its rate of development, thus \textit{acute myeloid leukaemia} refers to a particularly aggressive and rapidly proliferating class of leukaemia which affects the myeloid cell line. This occurs when undifferentiated myeloid cells called myeloblasts acquire mutations which hinder further differentiation but allow for their rapid clonal proliferation \citep{Khwaja2016}. The causative genetic or cytogenetic abnormalities which induce cancer are reflected in the cell's transcriptome, which can be profiled using a number of technologies. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has gradually replaced previous methods of measuring a cell's RNA profile, namely microarrays and Sanger sequencing. It offers numerous advantages over these previous methods, such as less technical noise, high throughput of transcriptomic data, and a lower overall cost for the mapping of large transcriptomes \citep{zhao2014comparison}. 

The specifics of the RNA-seq workflow are highly variable, with many competing techniques for many steps in the process currently in use. A generic representation of the wet-lab processes involved can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:rnaseq_biorender}. An essential step common to every workflow is the extraction of RNA from the sample tissue or cells. This is a particularly tricky endeavour as RNA is chemically unstable due to the hydroxyl groups at the 2' and 3' positions, facilitating RNase activity (RNA-degrading enzymes) \citep{green2019win}. This issue is compounded by the ubiquity and chemical resilience of RNAses, meaning that special care must be taken to avoid contamination of glassware and instruments that interact with the RNA \citep{green2019win}. The sample is lysed to extrude the contents of the cell, and DNA and proteins are removed via phase separation between two immiscible liquids. The end result should be the high-quality RNA in an aqueous solution. The resulting RNA is composed of messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) and various other categories of non-coding RNA (ncRNA), most notably ribosomal RNA which makes up 95\% of the total RNA and is irrelevant to our analysis \citep{kukurba2015rna}. This bulky rRNA is removed using oligo-dT primer beads or commercially available kits specific to the removal of rRNA \citep{peano2013efficient}. The next chronological step is library preparation, where RNA strands are fragmented, converted to their complimentary DNA (cDNA) strands and ligated to adapter sequences \citep{zhong2011high}. This adapter-ligated cDNA library is typically attached to a flow-cell, amplified and sequenced in a high-throughput sequencing platform which typically results in a FASTQ \citep{cock2010sanger} file. % Include more detail here?
This contains the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA in a text-based format. Each nucleotide base call is also assigned an ASCII character as a quality score. Phred quality scores are among the most widely used, which are numerical scores generally ranging from 10 to 60, logarithmically related to the probability of an erroneous base-call, represented as a single ASCII character \citep{ewing1998base}.

This brings us to the part of RNA-seq which was performed during this dissertation: the data analysis. This involves the construction of a pipeline consisting of multiple tools stitched together with the aim of gaining insight on the differentially expressed genes between samples. As a result of the decentralised nature of bioinformatics, and the potential variability of the data and goals of the researcher, there is no one-size-fits-all tool. The researcher constructing the pipeline must take into account a myriad of trade-offs for each tool for each step of the pipeline. All pipelines follow the same general format, however: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Quality Control} - This involves the visualisation of the sequencing data to assess its quality, identifying any potential sequencing errors. This step translates the quality scores embedded in FASTQ files into something more interpretable such as a line graph, among other metrics. Unlike other parts of the pipeline, this step does have a \textit{de facto} standard tool: FastQC \citep{andrews2010fastqc}, although it is not uncommon to use additional tools to analyse other quality metrics. Recognising certain patterns in data quality visualisation is essential to identifying the source of the problem \citep{stoler2021sequencing}.
\item \textbf{Preprocessing} - This is an optional step performed only if \ac{QC} indicates that the data is usable but flawed. Nucleotides under a set Phred-score threshold are considered 'low-quality', thus have a high probability of being erroneous and are discarded. Further filtering based on other quality metrics such as the presence of primer sequences or low-complexity regions may also be performed \citep{martin2011cutadapt, prinseq++}.
\item \textbf{Alignment} - Reads are compared to a reference genome or reference transcriptome and aligned to the regions of highest similarity. There is often considerable overlap between the reads in terms of their nucleotide sequences which link the reads together.
\item \textbf{Quantification} - This step produces a gene count matrix containing the number of reads which fall within the coordinates of a particular gene. Typically, the row names would be gene IDs and column names would be the sample IDs, with each cell representing the number of reads which fall within that gene region.
\item \textbf{Normalisation} - Differences in the total read counts between samples is unavoidable due to imperfections during sequencing, but has to be accounted for for an unbiased comparison of multiple samples. This step may be fused with the previous one in certain tools. 
\item \textbf{Differential Expression} - Statistical tests are performed to see whether a significant difference exists between the normalised sample read counts and a benchmark sample considered to be 'normal' or 'healthy'. Every compared gene typically produces two values: the $log_{2}$ fold-change (logFC) and the p-value (adjusted for multiple testing). A threshold is applied to each of these to determine which genes should be considered as differentially expressed. If the logFC is positive, the gene is up-regulated, while if it is negative, the gene is considered down-regulated when compared to the benchmark sample.
\item \textbf{Downstream analysis} - Typically involves some form of visualisation of the \ac{DEG} to gain biological insight, but further analysis depends greatly on the research question. Possible routes are gene expression clustering, pathway analysis and functional term over-representation analysis \citep{conesa2016survey, chung2021best}.

\section{Motivation} 
Despite incremental improvements in treatment over the past few decades, average \ac{AML} 5-year survival rates remain at 28\% for affected individuals, which decreases with age and unfavourable cytogenetics, according to the SEER database \citep{sasaki2021novo}. Chemotherapy is currently standard practice for the treatment of \ac{AML}, despite its indiscriminate cytotoxic effects and resultant physiological consequences on the patient. As a result of their frail state, older adults usually cannot withstand the side-effects of this treatment and are instead put under palliative care with abysmal chances of even short-term survival \citep{lancet2018overall}. 

Recent decades have seen rapid progress in high-throughput sequencing techniques and our understanding of cancer biology, which have lead to the development of novel targeted treatments. One of these relatively recent approaches is differentiation therapy, where a pharmacological agent encourages differentiation in cancer cells. This alters the cancer's immature, stem-cell like state, halting its ability to rapidly proliferate and metastasise. The differentiation agent \ac{ATRA} has been particularly successful in treating the \ac{AML} subtype of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), managing to achieve a 90\% survival rate, while avoiding the severe cytotoxic side-effects of chemotherapy \citep{kim2015selection}. This dissertation is an attempt to use recent developments in next-generation sequencing and RNA-seq technology to further increase our arsenal in our war against cancer, specifically against \ac{ATRA}-resistant strains of \ac{AML}, whilst sparing the patient of the severe side-effects associated with chemotherapy.

\section{Aim and Objectives} 
This dissertation shall be performing RNA-seq analysis on data generated during a PhD thesis by \cite{Gatt2016}. During this preliminary study, an \ac{ATRA}-resistant HL-60 cell line was used to model \ac{AML}, and was treated with a phenolic mixture across four time-points (further detail in the Section \ref{method:prelim study}). The general aim of this dissertation is to observe the effects of this phenolic treatment on the HL-60â€™s transcriptome over time through bulk RNA-seq analysis. To achieve this, six objectives must be attained:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine which bioinformatics tools are best suited to be used in this RNA-Seq pipeline given the current dataset
\item Perform quality control checks on the data files at various stages of analysis
\item Align the reads to a recent human reference genome release
\item Normalise the data to account for differences between samples and between genes.
\item Conduct differential expression analysis
\item Visualise and interpret the gene expression data to assess the level of differentiation caused by phenol treatment occurring across the three time points
\end{enumerate}

\section{Approach}
The first step to achieve the stipulated aim was a thorough literature review to become acquainted with commonly used tools in RNA-seq analysis and their respective limitations and trade-offs. This allowed for the identification of the optimal tools suited for our dataset, which can be described as a time series with four time points, with a single sample representing each time point. 

FastQC is an essential starting point in any Omic data analysis, due to its provision of extensive quality metrics. FastQScreen \citep{wingett2018fastq} added another layer of information by checking the sequences against multiple reference genomes, human and non-human, to check for contamination. Cutadapt \citep{martin2011cutadapt} was used to trim adapter sequences and short reads. It was accessed through the wrapper script Trim Galore! \citep{trimgalore} which redirects the trimmed data back to FastQC to reassess the quality of the reads. Prinseq++ \citep{prinseq++} was then used to remove ambiguous reads and regions of low-complexity. The trimmed and filtered FASTQ files were aligned to the GRCh38.p13 reference genome \citep{ref} using the \ac{STAR} aligner \citep{Dobin2013}. \ac{STAR} was called through RSEM \citep{li2011rsem}, which after alignment, estimates gene and isoform expression levels. 

The four gene count files, containing the gene IDs and expected read counts, were imported into R \citep{R} to follow the edgeR \citep{edger} workflow, including \ac{TMM} normalisation. A control sample (which might be referred to as the '0 hour' time point) was used as the baseline to which the three other time points where compared to in a pairwise comparison fashion. The lack of replicates in this study, while a common and often unavoidable consequence of the high costs associated with RNA-seq experiments, severely restricted the possible options for differential expression analysis. The statistical tests used by the leading \ac{DGE} tools edgeR and DESeq2 \citep{love2014moderated} both require the estimation of dispersion, which cannot be calculated using a single sample. As a workaround, the edgeR vignette\footnote{https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/edgeR/inst/doc/edgeRUsersGuide.pdf} suggests an approximated value for the Biological Coefficient of Variation (BCV) based on similar studies, from which we can derive the dispersion. This approach, although inaccurate, was deemed as the most suitable method of \ac{DGE} given this dataset. These \ac{DEG}s were annotated and visualised for an overview of the differences between the samples, particularly how the transcriptome of the untreated samples changed over time with treatment. Pathway analysis was performed with a particular focus on those infamously deranged by cancer to gain further biological insight on the differentiation process occurring.

\section{Document Structure}
This chapter has provided a surface-level introduction to the theory behind this project, why it was undertaken and what it hopes to achieve.

In the following chapter, the \textbf{Background and Literature Overview} we will delve deeper into what is currently known about \ac{AML} and RNA sequencing techniques. It will provide an overview of the relevant literature, in particular recent studies which made use of RNA-seq analysis pipelines, and how their methods and findings influenced this project.

\textbf{Materials \& Methods} will focus on the work done to achieve the aforementioned aim and objectives. We will summarise the preliminary wet-lab work performed by Dr Vassallo Gatt  \citep{Gatt2016}, and describe in detail the steps taken to construct the RNA-seq pipeline to transform the data in four FASTQ files.

In the \textbf{Results} chapter, we will present a visual representation of how the data was transformed at each step of the pipeline. This section will largely contain the outputs of the steps described in the previous chapter.

The \textbf{Discussion} will describe the reasoning behind the construction of the RNA-seq pipeline, and justify the choice of tools and their chosen parameters. It will also compare our results with the results of previous literature, particularly comparing the top \ac{DEG}s and deranged pathways found in this study, with those associated with \ac{AML}. 

The final chapter, the \textbf{Conclusion}, will revisit the aim and objectives and discuss if there were achieved to a satisfactory degree. Here we will give a final summary of our interpretation of the results, what could have been improved, and proposals for future work on the topic.
