\chapter{Background \& Literature Overview}
\label{lit review}

The typical multicellular organism stores its genetic code as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), found identically in all its somatic cells (unless \textit{de novo} mutations occur). DNA is a biological polymer, consisting of a double-stranded polynucleotide chain. Each nucleotide monomer consists of a phosphate group, deoxyribose (a five-carbon sugar), and one of four nucleobases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T). These two strands are held together with a series of hydrogen bonds between the nucleobases, forming Watson-Crick base pairs. %On opposite strands, adenine and thymine form double hydrogen bonds, while guanine and cytosine form a stronger triple hydrogen bond.

DNA is just the general starting point in a series of information transfers described by the \textit{Central Dogma of Molecular Biology}, which the cell uses to ultimately produce its molecular products \citep{cobb201760}. Through the process of \textit{transcription}, the code from one strand of DNA is transferred onto a primary ribonucleic acid (RNA) transcript. RNA is similar to DNA except that it is single-stranded, has ribose as its five-carbon sugar and uses the nucleobase \textit{uracil} instead of \textit{thymine}. This primary transcript is modified into ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) or messenger RNA (mRNA). All three are involved in \textit{protein synthesis}, although mRNA is especially relevant to this dissertation since the protein sequence can be deduced from the mRNA sequence. These molecular products shape the cell's appearance, define how it interacts with external or internal stimuli, and allows it to perform its intended functions. They give each cell type a characteristic RNA profile which can be measured through RNA-seq (Described in Section ???).



\section{Differentiation Pathways in the Hematopoietic System}
. Acute leukaemia occurs earlier in the differentiation pathway, allowing the blasts to divide more rapidly. \autoref{fig:cell_differentiation} shows the mature cell types that result from myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages, which both share \ac{HSC} as the common progenitor cell type.

\section{Acute Myeloid Leukaemia}

\ac{AML} is an aggressive form of cancer which is characterised by its rapid proliferation of myeloblasts. This occurs when undifferentiated myeloid cells acquire mutations which hinder further differentiation but allows for their clonal proliferation \citep{Khwaja2016}. This comes at the expense of the production of their healthy, differentiated counterparts: erythrocytes, platelets and granulocytes \citep{Khwaja2016}. It is an exception to cancers in that it does not form a tumour, which is usually analysed to determine the severity. Instead \ac{AML} is staged according to its subtype and other variables \citep{ACS2018}. It is the most common form of acute leukaemia, with an incidence rate of 4.3 per 100,000 in the United States \citep{Kouchkovsky2016}. One of the main risk factors is age, with a median age of diagnosis of 70 years, and with a slight male predominance \citep{juliusson2009age, Khwaja2016}. Acute myeloid leukaemia is synonymous with acute myelogenous leukemia, acute myelocytic leukemia, or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.

\subsection{Classification and Subtypes}
\label{Classification and Subtypes}
\ac{AML} is one of four main branches of leukaemia classification, the others being Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL), Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML) and Chronic Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (CLL) \citep{leukaemiabook}. Despite their cytogenic differences, there have been multiple reports of chronic leukaemia types transitioning into the more aggressive, acute form over time \citep{kaur2016rapid, frenkel1981acute, jacobs1984acute}. Treatment may vary depending on the subtype of the disease, which is why a rigid classification system and correct identification is important \citep{leukaemiabook}.

Each of these four leukaemia subtypes is subdivided into more specific classifications. \ac{AML} in particular is genetically and morphologically heterogeneous and can involve any single or a combination of myeloid lineages \citep{whoclassification, Kouchkovsky2016}. 

\subsubsection{The FAB classification system}
The \ac{FAB} classification, first produced in 1976, was an early attempt to distinguish subtypes of \ac{AML} \citep{bennett1976proposals}. The divisions were based on cell morphology and the relative quantities of myeloblasts and erythroblasts \citep{acsamlsubtypes}.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% AML categories are extremely heterogeneous, probably due to high genetic diversity

\subsubsection{The WHO classification system}

A more modern, and now more widely used system, is that devised in the \textit{\ac{WHO} Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues}, now in its revised 4th edition \citep{whoclassification}. \ac{AML} is here defined as having >20\% of the cells in the bone marrow being myeloblasts. The \ac{WHO} based their classification on a mixture of genetic, morphological and cytochemical criteria and based on the presence of other conditions. They define seven subcategories:

\begin{enumerate}
\item AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities
\item AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (MRC)
\item Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN)
\item AML related to previous chemotherapy or radiation
\item Myeloid sarcoma (also known as granulocytic sarcoma or chloroma)
\item Myeloid proliferations related to down syndrome (DS)
\item AML with chromosomal translocations and inversions
\end{enumerate}

These may be further classified according to their specific genetic or karyotypic abnormalities \citep{whoclassification}. Cases which do not fall into any of the above groups, are labelled as 'AML, not otherwise specified (NOS)' and are subject to a form of classification similar to the \ac{FAB} \citep{ACS2018}. Cases classified as having 'recurrent genetic abnormalities' are often sub-categorised and described according their their abnormality (similar to table \ref{tab:karyotype}, although not all are officially recognised as 'recurring abnormalities').

\subsection{Pathogenesis}
The genetic abnormalities leading to \ac{AML} are heterogeneous and complex, meaning that there are many different combinations of causative genetic or cytogenetic abnormalities which may lead to the \ac{AML} phenotype \citep{lindsley2015acute, whoclassification}. The genetic and karyotypic profile can have profound prognostic impact, affecting both therapeutic strategy and survival rate \citep{mrozek2000prognostic, whoclassification}. 

\subsubsection{Cytogenic Abnormalities}
Approximately 55\% of \ac{AML} patients have at least one cytogenic abnormality \citep{meyer2014translational}.  \cite{stolzel2016karyotype} note that patients with 3 unrelated cytogenic abnormalities, have a worse overall survival rate than \ac{AML} patients with a normal karyotype, and that the patients at most risk had $ \geq $4 unrelated cytogenic abnormalities. There are some exceptions, where the presence of certain abnormalities actually \textit{increases} survival rate with good response to treatment (Table \ref{tab:karyotype}).

%t(8;21) is a frequently oc­curring aberration in acute AML. It involves the fusion of the RUNX1 (runt-related transcription factor 1) gene on chromosome 21q22 and the RUNX1T1 (runt-related transcription factor 1; translocated to 1) gene on chromosome 8q22, resulting in the formation of the hybrid gene RUNX1/RUNX1T1. AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22), RUNX1/RUNX1T1 generally shows maturation in the myeloid lineage and is found in approximately 5\% of cases of AML. cite:https://atlasgeneticsoncology.org/haematological/1019/t(8;21)(q22;q22)-runx1-runx1t1

\subsubsection{Genetic Abnormalities}

If we reduce our frame of reference to the genetic level, we find that the aforementioned structural variants (Table \ref{tab:karyotype}) can trigger the activation of an \textit{oncogene}, or their fusion products (Table \ref{tab:karyotype}) can become an oncogene themselves. Some genes have the potential to cause cancer under abnormal conditions and are called \textit{proto-oncogenes}, and if said conditions are met, become the carcinogenic oncogenes. This carcinogenicity can be triggered by either a structural variant, a \ac{SNP} or gene amplification \citep{tabin1982mechanism}. This can cause up-regulation, over-activity or a change in function of the respective protein \citep{tabin1982mechanism}. These proteins are often the targets of cancer drugs \citep{liu2004new}.

Cells have evolved mechanisms to prevent carcinogenesis, through \textit{tumour suppressor genes}. These genes are typically involved in the regulation of cell division, DNA repair or induction of apoptosis. While proto-oncogenes require their up-regulation to induce cancer, tumour suppressor genes require down-regulation or complete deactivation. \cite{knudson1971mutation} suggested a 'two-hit hypothesis', that most tumour suppressor genes require the deactivation of both alleles for carcinogenesis to occur. Knudson theorised that early onset retinoblastoma (cancer of the retina) was caused by an inherited mutation (the first 'hit') and a second acquired mutation (the second 'hit'). Knudson explained late-onset of the disease as being non-inherited, with both 'hits' being acquired. 

%The TP53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene (>50%) in human cancer, indicating that the TP53 gene plays a crucial role in preventing cancer formation.[6] https://doi.org/10.2147%2FOTT.S53876

\subsection{ Treatment Methods}
\label{Treatment Methods}
Surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy and hormone therapy are common treatments used to kill cancer cells. While the specifics are partly dependent on the particular \ac{AML} subtype and the patient's condition, some variation of chemotherapy is standard practice. Treatment is typically split into four phases spread over a period of 2-3 years \citep{malard2020acute}:  

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Induction} - Uses chemotherapeutic drugs with the intention of achieving complete remission (no symptoms or signs of cancer) and restore normal cellular activity. Cytarabine (AraC) is one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs for \ac{AML}, often used in conjunction with others such as daunorubicin \citep{Robak2009}.
\item \textbf{Consolidation} - Consists of several short sequential courses of chemotherapy every two weeks, usually using stronger doses.
\item \textbf{Intensification} - Also called reinduction therapy, includes drugs similar to those used during the induction phase.
\item \textbf{Long-term maintenance} - Chemotherapy is performed for 2-3 years after complete remission to prevent, or slow down, the growth of any cancer remnants. At times, a bone marrow or stem cell transplant is sometimes necessary to replenish the supply of healthy hematopoietic cells
\end{enumerate}

In recent decades, advances in our knowledge of cancer biology and the development of more efficient high-throughput sequencing techniques, have lead to the identification of novel treatments which specifically target cancer cells, such as differentiation therapy. A key characteristic of cancer cells is remaining in a stem-cell like state, which allows for their rapid proliferation. Differentiation therapy is a relatively modern approach which attempts to induce the process of differentiation, where the malignant cells mature and lose their ability to proliferate, rendering them virtually harmless. The first successful differentiation agent was \ac{ATRA}, also known as tretinoin, used to treat acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) \citep{chomienne1990all}. This revolutionary drug managed to achieve a 90\% survival rate in APL patients, without the severe cytotoxic side-effects of traditional non-targeted chemotherapy \citep{kim2015selection}. There have been many attempts to emulate this with other compounds, with mixed results \citep{nowak2009differentiation}.

\subsection{The Model Cell Line: HL-60 }
A 36-year-old Caucasian woman was being treated for \ac{AML} at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, 1977, when she consented to being part of a study on her disease. Researchers took a blood sample, from which they extracted blasts for their analysis. Three years later, \cite{gallagher1979characterization} would describe for the first time the HL-60 cell line, now one of the most widely used \ac{AML} cell lines. The cells were described as having primarily neutrophilic and promyelocytic morphology, and thus initially placed into the \ac{FAB}-M3 'acute promyelocytic leukemia' category (see Section \ref{Classification and Subtypes}). Subsequent analysis of the cells' karyotype, performed by \cite{dalton1988hl}, revealed that they lacked the t(15;17) translocation characteristic of \ac{FAB}-M3, and were categorised as \ac{FAB}-M2, but development in nomenclature led the cell-line to finally being placed in the 'AML with maturation' category, using the \ac{WHO} system.

Early karyotypic studies had identified the t(5;17) \citep{von1990double} and t(9;14) translocations, together with a complex structural variant between chromosomes 5, 7, and 16 \citep{liang1999spectral}. A more recent study by \cite{jacob} used genome wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and RNA-seq to study structural variants in HL-60 genetic branches. They have shown the heterogeneity in HL-60 cell lines, but identified novel structural variants thought to be found in the original HL-60 sample: t(5;7)(q31.2;q32.3), t(5;16)(q33.3;q23.2-q23.3), t(7;16)(q32.3;q24.1), t(9;14)(q31.1;q23.2), and t(5;17)(q11.2;p11.2).

As mentioned in Section \ref{Treatment Methods}, \ac{ATRA} has been a success story in \ac{AML} differentiation therapy, and since its discovery, has been extensively used on HL-60 cells. This has led to the evolution of an ATRA-resistant branch of the HL-60 cell line, which was used during the study \citep{Gatt2016} which laid the foundation for this dissertation. \cite{fu2005effects} were successful in reverting this resistance through gene knockdown of MCL-1, which seems to produce the protein responsible for \ac{ATRA} resistance.

\section{RNA-seq: \textit{in vitro}}
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is the application of a \ac{NGS} technique to measure the quantity of RNA sequences in a biological sample, in a given moment \citep{zhong2009}. While non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) are involved in

%bulk vs single-cell

\subsection{temp: introudction content}

%The specifics of the RNA-seq workflow are highly variable, with many competing techniques for many steps in the process currently in use. A generic representation of the wet-lab processes involved can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:rnaseq_biorender}. An essential step common to every workflow is the extraction of RNA from the sample tissue or cells. This is a particularly tricky endeavour as RNA is chemically unstable due to the hydroxyl groups at the 2' and 3' positions, facilitating RNase activity (RNA-degrading enzymes) \citep{green2019win}. This issue is compounded by the ubiquity and chemical resilience of RNAses, meaning that special care must be taken to avoid contamination of glassware and instruments that interact with the RNA \citep{green2019win}. The sample is lysed to extrude the contents of the cell, and DNA and proteins are removed via phase separation between two immiscible liquids. The end result should be the high-quality RNA in an aqueous solution. The resulting RNA is composed of messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) and various other categories of non-coding RNA (ncRNA), most notably ribosomal RNA which makes up 95\% of the total RNA and is irrelevant to our analysis \citep{kukurba2015rna}. This bulky rRNA is removed using oligo-dT primer beads or commercially available kits specific to the removal of rRNA \citep{peano2013efficient}. The next chronological step is library preparation, where RNA strands are fragmented, converted to their complimentary DNA (cDNA) strands and ligated to adapter sequences \citep{zhong2011high}. This adapter-ligated cDNA library is typically attached to a flow-cell, amplified and sequenced in a high-throughput sequencing platform which typically results in a FASTQ \citep{cock2010sanger} file. % Include more detail here?
%This contains the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA in a text based format. Each nucleotide base call is also assigned an ASCII character as a quality score. Phred quality scores are among the most widely used, which are numerical scores generally ranging from 10 to 60, logarithmically related to the probability of an erroneous base-call, represented as a single ASCII character \citep{ewing1998base}.


%This brings us to the part of RNA-seq which was performed during this dissertation: the data analysis. This involves the construction of a pipeline consisting of multiple tools stitched together with the aim of gaining insight on the differentially expressed genes between samples. As a result of the decentralised nature of bioinformatics, and the potential variability of the data and goals of the researcher, there is no one-size-fits-all tool. The researcher constructing the pipeline must take into account a myriad of trade-offs for each tool for each step of the pipeline. All pipelines follow the same general format, however:

As implied by its nomenclature, the \ac{AML} subtype develops rapidly (acute), and mainly affects myeloid cells. \ac{AML} typically begins as immature myeloid cells (myeloblasts) that acquire mutations which alter key pathways responsible for differentiation and proliferation. This results in a rapid clonal expansion of the mutated myeloblasts in the blood marrow and peripheral blood \citep{whoclassification, Khwaja2016}.
